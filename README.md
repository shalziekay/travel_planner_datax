# Travel Planner - DataX

The app idea that my team and I came up with in Spring 2020's Data X class at UC Berkeley. The idea is a travel planner that personalizes your itinerary of attractions and restaurants based on user preferences and user recommendations, so travelers can get a personalized, well-suited experience for them. 

This repo includes code aspects of the project that I worked on - web scraping data from Trip Advisor and using the data to create an ordering/itinerary for the user.
